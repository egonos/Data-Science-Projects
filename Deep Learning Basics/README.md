# Project Overview

Deep learning algorithms are versatileâ€”they can work with tabular data as well as sensory data like images, text, and time series. However, this flexibility also makes it challenging to build and manage effective models. This repository provides practical examples of key machine learning problems that deep learning can solve.


## Contents

### 1. Image Classification Basics
* Includes two example projects where image classification algorithms are built from scratch.

* Features a project comparing several transfer learning models for cancer detection.


### 2. NLP Basics:

* Demonstrates how to build a text processing model from scratch.

* Explores the use of pre-trained embeddings in a text classification model.

* Highlights the role of recurrent networks in natural language processing.

* Contains an example project on text generation.

### 3. Time Series Basics

* Features two example projects illustrating how to use neural networks for time series analysis.


I hope this repository helps you better understand the flexibility and applications of deep learning. Enjoy exploring!
