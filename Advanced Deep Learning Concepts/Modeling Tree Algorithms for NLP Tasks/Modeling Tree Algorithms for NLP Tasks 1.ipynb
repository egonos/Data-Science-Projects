    "# The Goal of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "I enjoy using tree-based algorithms for data science. They are successful, interpretable, easy to use, relatively easy to tune, etc. However, they do not apply to a wide range of tasks such as image preprocessing, NLP tasks, and signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I wanted to show how to model NLP tasks for tree-based algorithms with the help of deep learning layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an example on the TensorFlow website about the same topic which you can find [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/tutorials/intermediate_colab).\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for this kernel is coming from [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09991.pdf) article. If you are curious about this topic I highly recommend checking that out.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "I used gradient boosting trees and ensemble trees for a binary text classification task. The hyperparameters of the tree algorithms come from the article. I also included a couple of different deep learning algorithms for comparison. Hope you'll enjoy it!\n",

The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning.

Things seemed to happen, but with no explanation of what was causing them or why.

Knowing nothing of it, I\\'m excited, hoping that the information will be presented well.<br /><br />I\\'ve done REAL quantum mechanics; this wasn\\'t it.<br /><br />This movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can, and will, occur to you, if you just open your eyes. Let\\'s think about that, for just a moment.<br /><br />Our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10^30 such subatomic particles. That is a million billion billion billion particles! The more \"mysterious\" quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50% probability of cancelling each other out completely.

It seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it, remembering my days in biology, but I cannot say.<br /><br />At least this film had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever they actually were) scene. Not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie, but the main character goes to a wedding, where she sees all different types of personalities \"driven\" by their peptides*, and then the film cuts to the dance floor, where we are spliced between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides, and a fully CG scene, filled with dancing peptides. The film, at that point, was trying to tell us how we\\'re \"addicted to emotions,\" so we\\'re treated to the full song of that smash hit, \"Addicted to Love.\"<br /><br />This scene was redeeming, because anyone who could go through THAT scene, and still take this movie seriously...well, you are the ones that need to \"open your eyes.\"', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",

Gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a Literary Club meeting in sea-side town an hour or so from Amsterdam. Verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how Gerard\\'s imagination twists reality.
