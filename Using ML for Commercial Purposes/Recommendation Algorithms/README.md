# Summary

Recommendation algorithms are everywhere, and they have recently started to excite me after I read *Nexus* by Yuval Noah Harari. I decided to work on this subject. This folder contains related work. All of the recommendation algorithms were written using `tensorflow-recommenders`. The beginner projects are similar to tutorials on the TensorFlow website, applied to a different dataset. The intermediate projects are mostly unique experiments. Each project includes a markdown file explaining the algorithms and structures I used. This folder can serve as supplementary material for those who are also curious about the subject.
