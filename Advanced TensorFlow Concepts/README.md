 This folder contains several projects that are related to advanced deep learning concepts.

 * `Siamese Networks`shows how to build a sample siamese network.

 * `Understanding GAN While Coding` illustrates how to build a GAN while showing the mathematical background.

 * `When Gradient Taping Makes Sense` explains how deep learning algorithms arrange their coefficients by using gradient methods.

 * `Modeling Tree Algorithms for NLP Tasks` shows how to use tree algorithms untraditionally and leverage them to use NLP purposes.


I hope you will find this folder useful.
