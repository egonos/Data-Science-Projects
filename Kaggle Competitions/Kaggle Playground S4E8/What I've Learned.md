# What I have learned?

1. Filling the missing values with summary statistics can boost the performance of the tree algorithms.
2. Always write codes with a small part of the data. When you see everything works fine, then run the code on the whole dataset.
3. Autogluon can be useful especially when it runs for a long time with GPU.
4. Labels can be encoded and oof prodicted probabilities can be used for meta learner.
5. Optuna LGBM integration makes the optimization procedure much more easier.
6. Stick with Python or Scikit Learn API from the beginning.
