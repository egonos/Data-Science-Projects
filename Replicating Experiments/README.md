# Project Overview

Andrew Ng suggests replicating experiments from academic papers to check if the results match and to learn more. This idea made sense to me, so I decided to try it. In this project, you will find replications of four deep learning papers. I hope this project  will be helpful for those who want increase their knowledge about deep learning.
