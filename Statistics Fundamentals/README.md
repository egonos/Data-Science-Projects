# Project Overview

Back in the day, I needed to perform several statistical analyses. During my investigations I realized that misinformation often leads people to use statistical tools incorrectly. I also made many mistakes. After completing my work, I had plenty of time to research this topic. The lessons I learned inspired this folder, which includes:

* `Applied Statistics 1 - Bayesian Statistics` shows how to perform Bayesian analysis as well as the core requirements.
* `Applied Statistics 2 - Frequentist Statistics` explains how to use traditional statistical tools.
* `Statistical Analysis on Community Health Dataset` serves as an example project illustrating how to use the statistical concepts.

I hope this folder will be useful for those who are overwhelmed by this subject.
