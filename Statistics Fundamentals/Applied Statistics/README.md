# Project Overview

Back in the day, I needed to perform several statistical analysis. During my investigations, I realized that there are lots of misinformation about statistics leading people use statistical tools incorrectly. I wasn't different, so I also made a lot of mistakes. After my work was done, I had a plenty of time to research this topic. The things that I've learned and the hard times that I've experienced led me to prepare this folder. It includes:

* `Applied Statistics 1 - Bayesian Statistics` shows how to perform Bayesian analysis as well as the core requirements.
* `Applied Statistics 2 - Frequentist Statistics` explains how to use the traditional statistical tools.
* `Statistical Analysis on Community Health Dataset` serves as an example project illustrating how to use the statistical concepts.

I hope this folder will be useful for those  who are overwhelmed with this subject.
