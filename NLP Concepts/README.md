# Overview

Welcome to NLP Concepts! This series aims to introduce the key tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While creating these notebooks, I referred to [Speech and Language Proceesing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book.pdfstart) by Jurafsky. You are encouraged to follow the notebooks alongside that reference for a deeper understanding.

I hope you find this series helpful and informative!
